#### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
**M.S. Graduate Research   
Department of Biological Sciences, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR. (2016-Present)**  
Research Advisor: Timothy Evans, Ph.D.  
Investigate the role of Robo1's five Ig domains, three fibronectin (Fn) type-III repeats, and the minimal ectodomain coding elements required in midline repulsion as well as how these domains influence the transient regulation of Robo1 by Commissureless (Comm) and Robo2.

**Undergraduate Honors Research   
Department of Biological Sciences, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR. (2014-2016)**   
Research Advisor: Timothy Evans, Ph.D.  
Study Slit-Robo1 axon guidance in the developing embryonic Central Nervous System (CNS) of _Drosophila melanogaster_ by utilizing a genomic structure-function based assay to investigate the role of Robo1's five immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains in midline repulsion.
